# Pinochio's Pizza & Sub
This app was created as Project 3 for CS50 Web Programming.

The project goal was to get more comfortable with Django and JavaScript. The application allows users to order food from the menu of [Pinochio's Pizza & Sub](http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html)

After singing up, users can add any item and extras to their cart. On the cart page, they can review their oder, remove some items and then either finalize or cancel their order. After this, the order is listed as an ongoing order, which means that the app's superusers can see the order, and even mark it as completed.
